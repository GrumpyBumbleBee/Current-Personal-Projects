// Takes vals of right key being pressed and left key being pressed.
// Calculates direction going in xspeed. (using 1's and 0's) (add 1 to x value or -1 to x value -> right vs left player movement)
//xspeed = move_speed * (right_key - left_key);		// Can adjust speed of character if needed (move speed)

// Recall most computer graphics grids have y vals increasing going down. Origin in upper left of grid.
//yspeed = move_speed * (down_key - up_key);

// Add to built in x and y values.
//x += xspeed;
//y += yspeed;
